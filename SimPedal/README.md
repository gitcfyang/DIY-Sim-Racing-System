# CNCDan - Sim Pedals
A laser cut, 3D printed, hall effect and load cell compatible racing simulator pedal design.

![Alt text](title.png "Sim Pedals")

This project is part of my DIY Sim racing series. The aim was to create a high quality set of sim racing pedals with no compromises, as cheaply as possible!

All of the pedal bodies are interchangeable so you can build any combination of pedals you wish. Hall effect and load cells are supported by all pedals so you can pick and choose what you feel will work best.

There are two folders that contain the parts you will need, Metal components and Printed components. The printed components are just .STL files and have quantities in their file names assuming a standard 3 pedal setup. For the metal components I have provided a STEP and DXF file for each part and a PDF with basic folding instructions for the folded parts which should be enough information for any cut service.

There are two different types of pedal plates included. Printed and metal. If you aren't using the metal version, there is no need to print the pedal mounts or the pedal form as the printed pedals incorporate the mount and the plate into one part. 

If you're planning to fold your own parts, you can just order 6x of the "3mm Pedal Base Plate" and ignore the "3mm Pedal Base Plate Mirrored" file as they are identical parts just folded the opposite direction. This will save you some money!

#### Software
After many requests, I've included software for the pedals to be used as a standalone device. Because my pedals are now attached to my steering wheel directly, I can't easily test this so I've had to include calibration code which is completely untested. The controller code itself should work and I'm fairly confident the calibration process will work, but let me know if you have issues and I should be able to fix them!

Please note, this code will only work on one of the 32u4 based Arduino boards such as the Pro Mini or Leonardo.

In order to compile the code, you will need to install the HX711 library into Arduino IDE. It should show up in the library manager as an option if you search for it, no need to add it manually.

Once you've flashed the code to your arduino, you will need to open the serial monitor in arduino (ensure your Baud rate is set to 115200) and enter Y into the console to begin calibration. The calibration will run for 1 minute. Move all the pedals in and out to both extents during this period and the software will record and store the maximum and minimum values.

You can repeat this process at any time if you move a sensor or otherwise change something that results in the need for a re-calibration.
